# Football Data Analytics 

Welcome to my football data analytics projects! 

This repository contains a series of notebooks that explore different aspects of football metrics, such as Expected Goals (xG), shot analysis, and passing metrics. The project leverages data from StatsBomb to analyze and derive key insights into football matches and player performance.
