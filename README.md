# Football Data Analytics 

Welcome to my football data analytics projects! 

This repository contains a series of notebooks that explore different aspects of football metrics, such as Expected Goals (xG), shot analysis, and passing metrics. The project leverages data from StatsBomb to analyze and derive key insights into football matches and player performance.

The football metrics are designed to provide more insight into a team's tactics, player roles, and overall match dynamics.

1. Expected Goals (xG)

Definition: xG measures the quality of a shot based on various factors like distance from goal, angle, and type of play (e.g., a cross, through-ball, etc.). The idea is to quantify how likely a shot is to result in a goal.

Example: In a match between Liverpool and Manchester City, a shot taken from 6 yards out with no defenders nearby may have an xG of 0.75, meaning there’s a 75% chance it should result in a goal. If the player misses, they "underperform" compared to their xG.


2. Pass Network Visualization

Definition: A pass network shows how players link up through passing during a match. It helps identify key playmakers, team structure, and the flow of play.

Example: In a match between Barcelona and Real Madrid, you might see that Messi is heavily involved in central play, while the full-backs exchange a lot of passes on the flanks. The thickness of the lines shows the frequency of passes between players.


3. Pressing Intensity (PPDA)

Definition: Passes Allowed Per Defensive Action (PPDA) is a measure of how much pressure a team applies when defending. It calculates the number of passes the opponent is allowed to complete before a defensive action (e.g., tackle or interception) is made.

Example: If Liverpool allows Manchester United to complete 6 passes before making a defensive action, their PPDA would be 6, indicating a high pressing intensity.


4. Player Heatmaps

Definition: A heatmap visualizes the areas of the pitch where a player spends most of their time, based on events like passes, shots, or tackles.

Example: In a match, Kevin De Bruyne’s heatmap may show that he spends most of his time in the right half-space, indicating his role as a right-sided attacking midfielder.


5. Team Style of Play Analysis

Definition: This metric categorizes how teams approach their play, whether they use a direct, long-ball approach or prefer a build-up style with short passes. It can also analyze tempo and ball progression.

Example: Manchester City’s style of play is characterized by short, intricate passing and patient build-up, while teams like Leicester City under Brendan Rodgers may prefer a more counter-attacking, direct approach.


6. Goalkeeper Performance Analysis

Definition: This metric assesses goalkeepers based on save percentage, post-shot xG (how difficult the saved shots were), and the areas of the goal where they make their saves.

Example: Alisson Becker's save percentage might be 75%, and his post-shot xG could show that he consistently prevents goals from difficult shots, making him one of the top goalkeepers.


7. Dribble and Progressive Runs Analysis

Definition: Dribbles refer to attempts by a player to bypass opponents, while progressive runs measure how a player moves the ball forward significantly.

Example: Adama Traoré might complete 10 successful dribbles in a match, advancing the ball into the final third with powerful runs that break defensive lines.


8. Defensive Actions Analysis

Definition: This includes various defensive actions such as tackles, interceptions, blocks, and pressing actions. It’s useful for understanding defensive contributions by individuals or teams.

Example: In a Chelsea vs. Arsenal match, N'Golo Kanté might record 5 tackles and 4 interceptions, showing how he disrupts the opposition's play in midfield.


9. Set Piece Analysis

Definition: Set piece analysis looks at how effective teams are at converting corners, free-kicks, and throw-ins into goal-scoring opportunities.

Example: In a match, Manchester United could have 10 corners, 2 of which result in goals. You can analyze the positioning of players during these set pieces to understand how they succeed.


10. Ball Progression Analysis

Definition: This tracks how teams or players move the ball forward, focusing on key passes, progressive runs, and dribbles.

Example: A player like Trent Alexander-Arnold might be a key ball progressor, completing 10 long-range passes that move the ball from the defensive third to the attacking third.
